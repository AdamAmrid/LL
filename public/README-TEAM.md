## File Placement

Create a `team` folder inside the `public` folder and place all images there:

```
project/
  public/
    team/
      imane-bachar.jpg
      adam-amrid.jpg
      imane-badari.jpg
      taha-zaamoun.jpg
      hafsa.jpg
```

## Image Guidelines

- Use square images (1:1 aspect ratio) for best results
- Ensure good lighting and clear faces
- Use professional or friendly photos that match the USN brand
- Images will be displayed as circular avatars
- If an image is missing, a placeholder icon will be shown automatically

## Note

The website will automatically show placeholder icons if images are not found, so the site will still function properly even without the images initially.
