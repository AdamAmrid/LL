# Video Background Setup

## Required Files

To use the animated video background in the hero section, please add your solidarity video file(s) to this `public` folder:

1. **solidarity-video.mp4** - Main video file (required)
   - Recommended format: MP4 (H.264 codec)
   - Recommended resolution: 1920x1080 or higher
   - Recommended length: 10-30 seconds (will loop)
   - File size: Keep under 10MB for best performance

2. **solidarity-video.webm** - Optional alternative format (for better browser compatibility)
   - Recommended format: WebM (VP9 codec)
   - Same resolution and length as MP4

3. **solidarity-video-poster.jpg** - Optional poster image
   - A static image that shows while the video loads
   - Recommended size: 1920x1080
   - This will be displayed before the video starts playing

## Video Guidelines

- The video should be related to solidarity, community, students helping each other, or UM6P campus life
- Keep it muted (audio is disabled in the background)
- Use warm, welcoming colors that match the UM6P brand
- Ensure good contrast so text remains readable (a semi-transparent overlay is applied)

## File Placement

Place all video files directly in the `public` folder:
```
project/
  public/
    solidarity-video.mp4
    solidarity-video.webm (optional)
    solidarity-video-poster.jpg (optional)
```

After adding the files, refresh your browser to see the video background in action!
